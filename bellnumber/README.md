# Bell Numbers (Number of ways to Partition a Set)

Given a set of n elements, find number of ways of partitioning it.
Examples:

Input:  n = 2
Output: Number of ways = 2
Explanation: Let the set be {1, 2}
            { {1}, {2} } 
            { {1, 2} }

Input:  n = 3
Output: Number of ways = 5
Explanation: Let the set be {1, 2, 3}
             { {1}, {2}, {3} }
             { {1}, {2, 3} }
             { {2}, {1, 3} }
             { {3}, {1, 2} }
             { {1, 2, 3} }. 
Solution to above questions is Bell Number.

Basic Finite State Machine with Datapath (FSMD) example to calculate the n-th bell number up to the 6th index.

## Install

These examples use [ModelSim&reg; and Quartus&reg; Prime from Intel FPGA](http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/?edition=lite), [GIT](https://git-scm.com/download/win), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), make sure they are installed locally on your computer before proceeding.

## Usage

1. Grab a copy of this repository to your computer's local folder (i.e. C:\projects):

    ```sh
    $ cd projects
    $ git clone https://github.com/Salem22/bellnumber.git
    ```
2. Use Visual Studio Code (VSC) to edit and view the design files:

    ```sh
    $ cd bellnumber
    $ code .
    ```
    Click on the toplevel.vhd file in the left pane to view its contents.
    
3. From the VSC View menu, choose Terminal, in the VCS Terminal, create a "work" library:

    ```sh
    $ vlib work
    ```
    
4. Compile all the design units:

    ```sh
    $ vcom *.vhd
    ```
    
5. Simulate your design. For example, if n = 5, then y = 52:

    ```sh
    $ vsim work.tb
    ```
